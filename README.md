# redd_count

The redd count repository serves as a data and code sharing site for Brandon Chasco's redd count abundance estimation project.  The purpose of the project is to estimate covariance amoung spring/summer Chinook salmon populations to backcast and re-construct total salmon abundance using redd counts and carcass collection data.
